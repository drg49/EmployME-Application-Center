EmployME Application Center is a .NET/React application that allows users to apply to posted job applications.

There are two user interfaces for EmployME. One side is the management system operated by the employer, while the other side is a job board, training center, and document management system for employees. 

This repository is the job board & training center for candidates/employees. If you would like to see the other repository for this project, please view [The EmployME Management System](https://github.com/drg49/EmployME-Management-System)
